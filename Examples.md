==An Example setup==
Typically, someone would run **mod\_icpquery** on an Apache together with **mod\_proxy\_balancer** or some other kind of application loadbalancing.

An Apache, in this configuration runs as a reverse proxy to distribute HTTP-traffic onto one or more upstream application servers. In situations, where it makes sense to cache the content generated by the application server, one can place a caching accelerator in front
of each application server. This is easier to configure, scales better and is more reliable, rather than passing all requests through a single caching server and distribute (ie. loadbalance) them afterwards.

A good caching server is [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org), as it has an Open Source License and has a small footprint.

The problem, with a distributed cache is, that the balancing proxy somehow has to know, which cache holds which object. This is where **mod\_icpquery** becomes part of the game.

![http://modicpquery.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/diagram.jpeg](http://modicpquery.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/diagram.jpeg)

  1. Apache sends an ICP request via UDP multicast to all of the application servers. This is shown by a dotted line.
  1. If the squid cache running in front of the application server, say 192.168.0.1, replies to this request, the originating HTTP request is passed to the caching server, ie. port 3128. It does not matter, whether the cache replied with **ICP\_HIT** or **ICP\_MISS**. If however, **mod\_icpquery** did not receive any ICP reply (a strong indication that the squid cache does not run), the HTTP request is forwarded directly to the application service, ie. port 8001, shown as 2'.
  1. In case, squid cache does not hold the requested object, the request is forwarded to the application server running on the local host.

### Configure mod\_rewrite to take advantage of mod\_icpquery ###
When **mod\_icpquery** is loaded into Apache, two additional functions become available as internal [RewriteMap](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritemap)'s. An example configuration is shown below.

An Apache portal server shall forward all dynamic requests starting with /wsgi/ to a cluster of three application servers. All static requests shall be handled by the portal server itself. The application servers have the IP addresses 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2 and
192.168.0.3 respectively. Their application service listens on port 8001.

On each of those hosts, an additional squid server is running in acceleration mode listening on port 3128. All requests reaching one of those hosts on port 3128 are delivered from the local cache, or forwarded transparently onto the application service. Note that the portal server must ensure, that requests are only forwarded to running services, and as we all know, they might be down for whatever reasons.

### Configure Squid-Cache as http-accelerator ###
only the relevant configuration options are shown
```
# Squid-Cache shall listen on port TCP/3128 and run in acceleration mode.
http_port 3128 accel defaultsite=localhost

# All incoming requests shall be forward onto the application server,
# which is running on the same host and listens on port TCP/8001.
cache_peer 127.0.0.1 parent 8001 0 no-query originserver

# Squid-Cache shall listen for ICP requests on port UDP/3130
icp_port 3130

# Create an ACL for 'all' IP-addresses
acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0

# Allow ICP requests from 'all' IP-addresses
icp_access allow all
```
