Summary: Extend Apache's mod_rewrite by internal mapping functions using ICP.

%description
Apache mod_rewrite provides ways to map values to attributes using the
directive RewriteMap. RewriteMap can use flat mappings files, hashed
mapping files, internal functions and external rewriting programs.
One not well known feature of mod_rewrite is to extend this functionality
with internal functions, which can be defined in a seperate Apache module.
This allows to do some complex and time consuming mappings, since 
mapping requests do not have to be passed through one single pipe, as
in the case of an external rewrite program.

mod_icpquery is a package which can be used to find objects on caching
servers by sending an UDP query. This query conforms to RFC2186 also
known as ICP and can be handeld by various HTTP-caching servers such
as squid. A cache-server handling ICP should reply to an ICP-query
with an ICP-response indicating if it holds the desired object in its
cache or not.
mod_icpquery is able to send UDP datagrams to a list of unicast and/or
multicast IP-addresses.
